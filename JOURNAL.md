Finding web elements in eBay was so hard that I found a simpler site to easily select web elements.
Migrated from eBay.com.au to Orange HRM.

Maximised browser size. 
Wrote a test to search "iPhone" to ensure that the first item in the result includes the word in the title. But selecting the first item in the list is difficult so still trying.
